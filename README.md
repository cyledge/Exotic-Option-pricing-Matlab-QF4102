# Exotic-Option-pricing-Matlab-
Here is a few projects related to Option Pricing. As there are some exotic options, like Asian, Barrier and Lookback options, numerical methods including similarity reduction, forward shooting grid and finite difference scheme. 

Assm1:
- Black-Scholes and binomial tree method for European Barrier call option
-  floating-strike lookback call option (similarity reduction)
-  fixed-strike geometric average Asian call option (two-state-variable binomial tree)

Assm2:
- European vanilla call option (finite difference scheme)
-  fixed-strike arithmetic Asian call option (two-state-variable forward shooting grid)

Assm3:
-  two-asset European option (Monte-Carlo with control variate)
-  American vanilla call option (finite difference scheme)
